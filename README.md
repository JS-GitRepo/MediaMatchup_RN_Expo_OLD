# MediaMatchup_ReactNative-OLD
Transitioning MediaMatchup.app to React Native

We used the "Blank with Typescript and Tabs" demo to begin our project in expo. We found this helpful initially, but eventually
cumbersome in learning the absolute basics of React Native, Expo, and React Navigation. For this reason, we have created a new 
repo where we are building the application from a truly blank Expo project state.
